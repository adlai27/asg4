Assignment 4: Lighting

Notes to Grader:
Referred to the videos provided for help with all steps and requirements, and code online in the textbook, as well as ChatGPT to complete assignment, and also online sources included down below for reference.


I used the base code for my blocky world, and added lighting according to the instructions, as well as the needed elements, specially, the sphere, cube, and lighting.
